    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>An easy smoked chicken wing recipe that will satisfy the family when you feel like having some bbq but not sitting around a smoker for 12 hours. This chicken wing recipe was inspired by a trip to Montgomery,AL where I tried some of the best smoked wings I've ever had. This inspiration comes from Moe's BBQ and hope that this recipe does it justice.</p>
